        <h2>Your Mission</h2>
        <p>Should you choose to accept it... </p>
        <p>You are a Treasure Hunter, using the newest in treasure hunting technologies: "Hot/Cold-ometer".</p>
        <p>
            This technology works simply: Sweep your detector (cursor) back and forth over the field...Until you get a sense for your bearings! 
            The readout will change from green to red if you get further from the treasure, and red to green as you get closer. 
        </p>
        <p>When you find the treasure, your detector will dig automatically, so keep sweeping until you find your rewards!</p>
        <p>The harder the treasure to find, the bigger the payout, but they don't call it "hunting" for nothing...</p>
        <p>Happy digging, best of luck, and enjoy your finds!</p>
